# Project: Simple Search Engine

A version of Tic-Tac-Toe which allows 2 players to play against each other.

## Stages 

### Stage #1 String theory

To start things off, the program needs to be able to print any state of the field. Youâ€™ll write a serious multi-line program using a lot of prints.

### Stage #2 Expand the search

With the help of arrays and linear search, add more strings to the program and search for specific data from that input.

### Stage #3 User menu

Using switch operator and methods, create a user menu for your search engine

### Stage #4 X-files

Enable your search engine to search for data stored in the files

### Stage #5 Inverted index search

Working with lists and maps, build the inverted index to enhance your search

### Stage #6 Search strategies

Get familiar with patterns and learn to deal with more complex types of search
